\section{Thesis outline}

This thesis seeks answers to some various very important questions, covering various approaches and levels of detail.
It is very relevant to \hsapiens{} knowledge.

\subsection{\nameref*{chapter:chapter1}}

\refer{chapter:chapter1} focuses on a high level approach, using a common method in the field applied in a novel context.

\subsection{Chapter 2 Title} % replace with \nameref as above

Chapter 2 digs deeper, developing new methods based on the results in \refer{chapter:chapter1}, which create a new powerful approach for this problem.

Finally, I bring these threads back together in \refer{chapter:discussion} to give a perspective on the results and their implications for research.
