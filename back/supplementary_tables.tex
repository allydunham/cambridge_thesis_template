\setcounter{table}{0}
\renewcommand\thetable{S2.\arabic{table}}

% Include supplementary table here.
% I made each table in it's own file using https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to generate LaTeX tables from TSV files and then added them using \input with \clearpage between them.
% The code above resets the figure numbering and sets them to be numbered S2.X as for supplementary figures.
